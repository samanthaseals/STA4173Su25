The full syllabus is available through Classmate and/or Canvas.\n\nInstructor Information\n\nDr. Samantha Seals\nOffice: 4/344\n\n\n\nMeeting Times and Location\n\nTR 11:00 am-1:40 pm\n\n11:00 am–12:15 pm: Lecture\n12:30 pm–1:15 pm: Daily practice\n1:15 pm–1:40 pm: Daily quiz\n\nPhysical classroom: 4/406\nZoom classroom: see Canvas or full syllabus for link\n\n\n\nOffice Hours\n\nMonday: 2:00–4:00 pm (Central)\nWednesday: 2:00–4:00 pm (Central)\nOther times by appointment\n\n\n\nGrading and Evaluation\nThe course grade will be determined as follows:\n\nDaily practice (25%): Each meeting day, students will complete an activity using Quarto and R. The resulting .html file should be submitted to the designated dropbox on Canvas by 11:59 pm on the specified date (see Canvas).\nDaily quizzes (10%): Each meeting day, students will complete a timed quiz on Canvas. Time will be given during class for completion.\nAssignments (40%): Every module will finish with an assignment to demonstrate the knowledge gained. These will be like the daily practice, but putting everything in the module together. The resulting .html file should be submitted to the designated dropbox on Canvas by 11:59 pm on the specified date (see Canvas).\nFinal Exam (25%): The final exam will be a timed concepts-based exam. While there may be some calculations needed, you will not be processing raw data. The final exam will be on Canvas on August 7, 2025. All students will have 3 hours to complete the exam.\n\n\n\nLate Policy\nAssigments have due dates, however, the dropboxes will not close until the end of the semester. All students are automatically granted “extensions” without question.\nNote that if there is not a submission when I go to grade (after the initial deadline), I will assign a zero (0) and request that you submit the assignment when you are able to. This is only for record keeping purposes. There is no penalty for submitting late and a full grade will be given upon review of your submission.\nExtensions are not available for daily practice, daily quizzes, or the final exam."

We’ll cover:\n\nSummary statistics and data visualizations.\nBasics of statistical inference:\n\nConfidence intervals for one mean,\nHypothesis testing for one mean.\n\nGetting started with R, RStudio, and Quarto.\n\nBasic R syntax: vectors & data frames/tibbles, functions, and the tidyverse.\nYour first Quarto document.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n🌱 Module 1: Exploring Continuous Outcomes in Two Groups\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this module, we explore methods for comparing continuous outcomes between two groups. We’ll cover:\n\nTwo-sample t-test for independent samples\n\nPaired t-test for dependent samples\n\nAssumptions on t-tests and how to assess\nWilcoxon rank-sum test\n\nWilcoxon signed-rank test\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n🐚 Module 2: Exploring Continuous Outcomes in More Than Two Groups\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this module, we explore methods for comparing continuous outcomes between three or more groups. We’ll cover:\n\nOne-way ANOVA\nTwo-way ANOVA\nAssumptions on ANOVA and how to assess\nPosthoc testing (multiple comparisons)\nProfile plots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n🐬 Module 3: Exploring Regression Modeling\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this module, we’ll explore describing the relationship between two continuous variables. We’ll cover:\n\nBivariate correlation\n\nPearson’s\nSpearman’s\n\nSimple linear regression\nMultiple regression\nAssumptions on regression and how to assess\nRegression diagnostics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n🐢 Module 4: Exploring Categorical Outcomes\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this module, we will begin exploring categorical outcomes. We will begin by reviewing analyses learned in STA2023 (Elements of Statistics):\n\nOne-sample proportions\nTwo-sample proportions\n\nWe will continue by expanding our knowledge:\n\n\\(\\chi^2\\) goodness-of-fit\n\\(\\chi^2\\) test for independence\nLogistic regression"
