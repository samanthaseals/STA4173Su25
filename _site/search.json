She designs a controlled experiment where each participating pony will complete the same memory test both before and after the spell is cast. By comparing each pony’s performance before and after the treatment, Twilight hopes to determine whether her spell truly boosts memory or if any observed changes are simply due to chance. Twilight records the number of items each pony can remember in both sessions and she is particularly interested in whether the differences in memory scores after the spell show consistent improvement across her group of test subjects.\n1.

The resulting .html file should be submitted to the designated dropbox on Canvas by 11:59 pm on the specified date (see Canvas).\nDaily quizzes (10%): Each meeting day, students will complete a timed quiz on Canvas. Time will be given during class for completion.\nProjects (40%): Every module will finish with a project to demonstrate the knowledge gained. These will be like the daily practice, but putting everything in the module together. The resulting .html file should be submitted to the designated dropbox on Canvas by 11:59 pm on the specified date (see Canvas).\nFinal Exam (25%): The final exam will be a timed concepts-based exam. While there may be some calculations needed, you will not be processing raw data. The final exam will be on Canvas on August 7, 2025. All students will have 3 hours to complete the exam.\n\n\n\nLate Policy\nProjects have due dates, however, the dropboxes will not close until the end of the semester. All students are automatically granted “extensions” without question.\nNote that if there is not a submission when I go to grade (after the initial deadline), I will assign a zero (0) and request that you submit the assignment when you are able to. This is only for record keeping purposes. There is no penalty for submitting late and a full grade will be given upon review of your submission.\nExtensions are not available for daily practice, daily quizzes, or the final exam."
