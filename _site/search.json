The resulting .html file should be submitted to the designated dropbox on Canvas by 11:59 pm on the specified date (see Canvas).\nDaily quizzes (10%): Each meeting day, students will complete a timed quiz on Canvas. Time will be given during class for completion.\nAssignments (40%): Every module will finish with an assignment to demonstrate the knowledge gained. These will be like the daily practice, but putting everything in the module together. The resulting .html file should be submitted to the designated dropbox on Canvas by 11:59 pm on the specified date (see Canvas).\nFinal Exam (25%): The final exam will be a timed concepts-based exam. While there may be some calculations needed, you will not be processing raw data. The final exam will be on Canvas on August 7, 2025. All students will have 3 hours to complete the exam.\n\n\n\nLate Policy\nAssigments have due dates, however, the dropboxes will not close until the end of the semester. All students are automatically granted “extensions” without question.\nNote that if there is not a submission when I go to grade (after the initial deadline), I will assign a zero (0) and request that you submit the assignment when you are able to. This is only for record keeping purposes. There is no penalty for submitting late and a full grade will be given upon review of your submission.\nExtensions are not available for daily practice, daily quizzes, or the final exam."

They:\n\nTakes input (ingredients, or data),\nDoes something with it (follow recipe, or perform calculations),\nGives back a result (baked good, or statistics).\n\nSome functions in R are available as soon as you open RStudio (this is “base R”).\n\ne.g., mean(), sd()\n\nOther functions are not available and must be called in after you start RStudio (these are “packages”).\n\ne.g., after I call in library(tidyverse), I can use summarize(mean(), sd())\nWe will always need library(tidyverse) because of %&gt;% (pipe operator)."
