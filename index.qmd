::: {.callout-tip title="üìù Module 0: Review & R Foundations" collapse="true" open="true"}
In this introductory module, we will review essential concepts from STA2023 (*Elements of Statistics*) and get set up with the tools used throughout the course. We'll cover:

- Summary statistics and data visualizations.
- Basics of statistical inference:
    - Confidence intervals for one mean,
    - Hypothesis testing for one mean.
- Getting started with R, [RStudio](https://rstudio.hmcse.uwf.edu), and Quarto.
    - Basic R syntax: vectors & data frames/tibbles, functions, and the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/).
    - Your first Quarto document.

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" title="üå± Module 1: Exploring Continuous Outcomes in Two Groups"}
In this module, we explore methods for comparing continuous outcomes between two groups. We'll cover:

- Two-sample *t*-test for independent samples  
- Paired *t*-test for dependent samples  
- Assumptions on *t*-tests and how to assess
- Wilcoxon rank-sum test  
- Wilcoxon signed-rank test

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" title="üêö Module 2: Exploring Continuous Outcomes in More Than Two Groups"}
In this module, we explore methods for comparing continuous outcomes between three or more groups. We'll cover:

- One-way ANOVA 
- Two-way ANOVA
- Assumptions on ANOVA and how to assess
- Posthoc testing (multiple comparisons) 
- Profile plots

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" title="üê¨ Module 3: Exploring Regression Modeling"}
In this module, we'll explore describing the relationship between two continuous variables. We'll cover:

- Bivariate correlation
    - Pearson's
    - Spearman's 
- Simple linear regression
- Multiple regression
- Assumptions on regression and how to assess
- Regression diagnostics

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true" title="üê¢ Module 4: Exploring Categorical Outcomes"}
In this module, we will begin exploring categorical outcomes. We will begin by reviewing analyses learned in STA2023 (*Elements of Statistics*):

- One-sample proportions
- Two-sample proportions

We will continue by expanding our knowledge:

- $\chi^2$ goodness-of-fit
- $\chi^2$ test for independence
- Logistic regression
