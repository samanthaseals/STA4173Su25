# STA4173 Biostatistics Summer 2025

Welcome to STA4173 - Biostatistics for the Summer 2025 semester! This course

- is an 8-week <u>synchronous</u> (live) course with students both on campus and on Zoom.
- is a senior-level second course in applied statistics. 
- has been designed for STEM majors, not solely those majoring in mathematics and/or minoring in statistics.

Housekeeping:

- Please join the Discord server (link on Canvas and in syllabus).
    - It is expected that students will engage on Discord while learning the course material.
- Please enter class with an open mind and willingness to learn.
- You may join Zoom for office hours by *scheduling an appointment* with me on Navigate.
- There are no formal tests during the semester. Instead, you will complete projects to demonstrate your understanding.
- There *is* a final exam at the end of the semester.
    - I will not ask you to provide code in a timed environment.
    - I will have all code/output relevant to questions as part of the exam. (i.e., you will interpret the output.)

**Contacting Dr. Seals:** The optimal ways to contact me are either
