<!-- 
Symbols we will use in hypotheses and test statistics:
- \mu (mean); \mu_i
- M (median); M_i
- \sigma^2 (variance); \sigma^2_i
- \beta (regression coefficient); \beta_i
- p (proportion); p_i; \hat{p}_i
- t_0 (test statistic)
- F_0 (test statistic)
- chi_0^2 (test statistic)
- z_0 (test statistic)
-->  

- **Hypotheses:**
    - $H_0: \ $
    - $H_1: \ $

- **Test Statistic and *p*-Value**
    - $t_0 = $
    - $p = $

<!-- 
formatting note! if your p-value is small and would round to 0 if you were rounding to three decimal places, please state $p < 0.001$ instead (this is what we do in the real world).
-->
    
- **Rejection Region**
    - Reject $H_0$ if $p < \alpha$; $\alpha = $
    
- **Conclusion and interpretation**
    - Reject ($p<\alpha$) or fail to reject ($p \ge \alpha$). 
    - There is (reject) or is not (ftr) sufficient evidence to suggest *the alternative hypothesis in words*.

<!-- 
Remember:
- We NEVER accept a hypothesis! Ever! 
- The purpose of the interpretation is to put the results back into the original context.
