**Tiny Tina, the explosive-loving Bunker Master, is hosting her first-ever Wonderlands Bake-Off. Contestants from across the realm, including goblins, skeletons, and glitter-loving orcs, are competing to craft the most delicious, magical baked treats.**

**Each contestant submits one dessert for judging. The judging panel includes:**

- **[Tiny Tina](https://playwonderlands.2k.com/game-guide/characters/tiny-tina/), who values flair and sugar explosions,**
- **[Butt Stallion](https://playwonderlands.2k.com/game-guide/characters/butt-stallion/), who insists on elegance and frosting symmetry, and**
- **[Paladin Mike](https://playwonderlands.2k.com/game-guide/characters/paladin-mike/), who wants practical rations that still taste divine.**

**You, as the official Fateweaver Statistician, are tasked with determining what factors predict the panel's overall satisfaction rating.**

**Each contestant records the following:**
- ***glitter_level*: How much edible glitter was used (grams)**
- ***boom_factor*: A subjective rating (1–10) of how explosive the dessert was**
-	***frosting_thickness*: Thickness of frosting layer (mm)**
- ***overall_satisfaction*: Combined score from all three judges (0–100 scale)**

**1. Let's first summarize the data. Please use the appropriate `mean_median()` function to summarize the continuous variables in the dataset.**

```{r}

```

**2a. Create a scatterplot with overall satisfaction (*overall_satisfaction*) on the *y*-axis and glitter level (*glitter_level*) on the *x*-axis.**

```{r}

```

**2b. Create a scatterplot with overall satisfaction (*overall_satisfaction*) on the *y*-axis and boom factor (*boom_factor*) on the *x*-axis.**

```{r}

```

**2c. Create a scatterplot with overall satisfaction (*overall_satisfaction*) on the *y*-axis and frosting thickness (*frosting_thickness*) on the *x*-axis.**

```{r}

```

**3a. Find the pairwise Pearson's correlation values.**

```{r}

```

**3b. Find the pairwise Spearman's correlation values.**

```{r}

```

**3c. Which correlation should we report? Check the appropriate assumptions, then decide.**

```{r}

```

**3d. Using the results from the method chosen in Q3c, which variables are significantly correlated with overall satisfaction (*overall_satisfaction*)? Test at the $\alpha=0.05$ level. You do not need to typeset your individual results, but please back up your statements statistically (using results generated).**

```{r}

```

**3e. Are any results surprising given the graphs found in Q2 and the correlations reported in Q3d?**

Replace with your answer.

**4. Construct a regression model that models overall satisfaction (*overall_satisfaction*) as a function of glitter level (*glitter_level*), boom factor (*boom_factor*), and frosting thickness (*frosting_thickness*). Remember to state your resulting regression model.**

```{r}

```

<!-- vague set up below -- check my lecture .qmd file for how I typeset the models in class. -->
<!-- you will be plugging in values for \hat{\beta}_i based on your regression results. -->

$$\hat{y} = \hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 x_1 +\ ...$$

**4. Is this a significant regression line? Test at the $\alpha=0.05$ level. Remember to typeset your results.**

```{r}

```

Insert your typesetting here.

**5. Which, if any, are signficant predictors of overall satisfaction (*overall_satisfaction*)? Test at the $\alpha=0.05$ level. You do not need to formally write the hypothesis tests, but please provide a statement for each predictor, backed up statistically (using results generated).**

```{r}

```

**6a. Please provide a formal interpretation for glitter level (*glitter_level*).**

Replace with your answer.

**6b. Please provide a formal interpretation for boom factor (*boom_factor*).**

Replace with your answer.

**6c. Please provide a formal interpretation for frosting thickness (*frosting_thickness*).**

Replace with your answer.

**7. Please write a brief summary paragraph for Tiny Tina. Include information about your summary statistics, slope interpretations (you can be more general here -- remember that she is 13 and not a statistician/data scientist), and test results (frame this as what matters most according to the model we constructed).**

Replace with your answer.
